# Flow-Field-with-opencv
- Perlin Noise Flow Feild + Computer Vision == cool stuff
## Setup
- type ```pip install requirements.txt``` in terminal
- ``` python main.py ```
## How To Play
- rock -> attractive force
- paper -> repulsive force

- press 'q' to quit / crt + c in terminal
## Play with the attributes
![img2](assets/img/particle_win.png)
- maximum speed of the particles
- radius of particels
- trajectory - useless
- theme - future feature

![img3](assets/img/field_win.png)
- scale of each vecto
    - Low scale may result in low FPS
- incremental value of perlin noise
- octave of perlin noise
- number of Particles
    -Too much particles may result in low performance
- Force of field strength
